# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, email our security team at `security@example.com` with the details of the vulnerability and instructions for reproducing it. We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days.

When reporting, do not include tenant identifiers, secrets, or electronic protected health information (ePHI) in your submission. Provide a proof of concept and any relevant logs without disclosing sensitive data.

## Response Process

Upon receipt of a vulnerability report we will:

1. Acknowledge the report and request any additional information.
2. Work to verify and reproduce the issue.
3. Determine the appropriate fix and schedule a release.
4. Credit the reporter if desired and coordinate disclosure.

We aim to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. If a fix requires significant changes, we will provide a timeline and status updates.

## Scope

This project consists of PowerShell scripts and modules for auditing Microsoft 365 environments. It does not store or process ePHI. Reports that include tenant-specific data or credentials will be discarded for safety.

## Public Communication

Once a vulnerability has been addressed we will disclose the issue and resolution in the project’s release notes. Until a fix is released we ask reporters to keep vulnerability details confidential.
